And it's called Augmented Roll a Ball because I'm the most uncreative idiot on the planet and couldn't think of a cool name for my project when I made the repository. But, I digress.\r\n\r\n### How to Play\r\nThe game has two players. Each rolls a ball around and tries to collect the golden cubes. When the cubes are all collected, the player with more points is the winner. Collisions with walls and each other's ball will detract points.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nPlayer 1: WASD to move around, SPACE to jump.\r\nPlayer 2: Arrows to move around, ENTER to jump.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWritten by @ananthamapod.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Augmented Roll a Ball?
